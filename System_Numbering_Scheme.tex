The version number is composed of 4 numbers.
The first number is the ``major'' version number, which is incremented for each significant release of the system.
The second number is the ``minor'' version number, which is updated for less significant releases of the system.
The third number is the ``patch level'', which is updated for releases that provide bug fixes and the like.
The fourth number is the ``build'' number, which is derived from the source code version control system.
