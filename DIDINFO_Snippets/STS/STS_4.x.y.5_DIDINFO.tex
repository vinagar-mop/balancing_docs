For each test result, the following information shall be provided, as applicable:

\item Maximum/minimum allowable test duration, in terms of time or number of events,
\item Maximum number of interrupts, halts, or other system breaks that may occur,
\item Allowable severity of processing errors,
\item Conditions under which the result is inconclusive and re-testing is to be performed,
